Design Thinking and UX Strategy
This phase is foundational — we start by understanding our end users and create interfaces
that guide them to spiritual connection, expression, and community.
Goals:
● Ensure ease of use for believers, churches, and creators.
● Reduce friction in content creation, browsing, and communication.
● Maintain faith-centric, clean, uplifting visuals.
UX Approach:
● Research faith-based user personas.
● Map user journeys (connecting, posting, creating events, moderation).● Design for accessibility and inclusiveness across age groups.
UI System:
● Reusable, responsive component library (cards, modals, navs, calendars).
● Faith-themed visual design with customizable elements for branding.
● Modular structure: faith pages, feeds, messaging, moderation tools.
Phase 1: Infrastructure & Architecture Setup
Approach:
● Configure environment variables, code linting, CI/CD hooks (if needed).
● Define consistent folder structure for maintainability.
Authentication & Roles:
● JWT-based login system with refresh tokens.
● Define roles: believercreatoradminsuperadmin.

● Middleware-based access control with route guards.
Data Modeling:
● MongoDB schemas designed for extensibility:
○ Users – roles, profile, connections.
○ FaithPages – org-level profiles for churches, creators.
○ Posts – text/image content with tags, reactions.
○ Reactions, Comments – amen/bless logic, threaded replies.○ Moderation – flag queues, ban records.
○ Events – recurring spiritual activities or group meetings.
Phase 2: Core MVP Modules Development
Faith Directory
● Churches and creators can build FaithPages.
● Search and filtering by name, category (e.g., youth, worship).
● Users can claim pages, triggering a verification flow.
Rhythm Keeper
● Calendar for personal or group faith events.
● Habit tracker for prayer, study, spiritual routines.
● Shared tools for group/family planning.
Social Feed & Posting
● Believers post testimonies, images, praise reports.
● “Amen” and “Bless” reactions only — encourages positive dialogue.
● Comment threads with moderation and reply nesting.
● Algorithmic or chronological community feed.
Connections System
● Believers and orgs can connect or follow each other.
● View My Network to browse one’s active faith community.Moderation Strategy
● Manual and auto-flagging of harmful content.
● Admin moderation queue with decision logging.
● AI-powered word filter to reduce profanity/politics.
Daily Word & Christian News
● Display a daily rotating Bible verse (from API or internal DB).
● Fetch faith-based news articles via RSS or headless CMS.
Messaging System
● Real-time 1:1 DMs with spiritually-aligned language and tone.
● WebSocket integration for responsiveness.
● Spam/profanity filters built-in for user safety.
Admin Oversight Tools
● Admindashboard for:
○ Role management.
○ Content moderation (flagged posts, user bans).
○ Metrics: post volume, report stats, growth indicators.
White-Labeling + Personalization
Theme & Branding System
● Allow each FaithPage to customize:○ Theme colors
○ Fonts
○ Logos
● Save/load themes from MongoDB for dynamic branding output.
Progressive Web App (PWA) Optimization
Mobile First Experience
● Fully responsive design with mobile-optimized UX.
● Installable PWA with offline support via service worker.
● Performance tuning using Lighthouse metrics and caching strategies.
Testing, Rollout, and Iteration Strategy
Testing Scope
● Component-level unit testing (UI & logic).
● API-level integration tests with mocked DB or in-memory stores.
● User testing loops — alpha, beta, post-launch.
Pilot Rollout
● Closed beta with selected churches and faith leaders.
● Collect feedback and behavior analytics.
● Iterate before open public MVP release.Final Polish & Refinement
● Polish typography, spacing, micro-interactions.
● Load testing, rate limit enforcement.
● Final QA and bug resolution.
